# Auto_NAV-FYP
This repository contains the code and documentation for our Final Year Project on Autonomous Navigation. The project focuses on developing a autonomous system that is capable of autonomous movement inside the campus environment.

The demostration of our autonomous system shown below:

### Map Overlay of Robotics Club and PCD of the Environment

The following images show key components of our autonomous navigation system. On the left, you can see the map overlay of the Robotics Club, which outlines the environment. On the right, we have the Point Cloud Data (PCD) image, which is crucial for understanding the surroundings for real-time navigation.
